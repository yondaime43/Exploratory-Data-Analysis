# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
According to the given data, let's imagine that we got a job in the advertising department team as a data analyst. The boss comes to us and says that several incomprehensible stories have happened: the charts have grown up for some reasons.

This project mainly focuses on following parts of data analysis and visualization:

1. Analyze jumps in advertisements
2. Calculating the CTR metric
3. Search for analytical bugs
